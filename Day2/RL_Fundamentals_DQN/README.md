# RL_Fundamentals_DQN

This example is a constructive modification of the DQN example provided by pytorch. To run the notebook, we suggest creating a python virtual environment (.venv), then running the following commands:

```
python -m pip install matplotlib
python -m pip install torch
python -m pip install numpy
python -m pip install gymnasium
python -m pip install pygame
```

Then, a simple way to run the jupyter notebook is through vs code's Jupyter extension. Simply set the jupyter kernel to use this virtual environment and select run all.
