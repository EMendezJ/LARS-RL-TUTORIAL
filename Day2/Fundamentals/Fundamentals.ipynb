    "# Overview of RL fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Q-learning strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to maximize the discounted, cumulative reward (the return). \n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, to maximize return, the correct action must be taken for every different state. To determine which is the correct action, the model needs to estimate the expected return for each action given a state, which is a tricky problem. This value we are trying to estimate is called Q-value, or action value. If we know the action value of every possible action at every possible state, choosing the action with the highest value at every state should give the maximum return (the problem is solved).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Temporal difference and discount factor\n",
    "\n",
    "To actually calculate an action's value, it needs to be compared with the next state-action pair's value. This difference is known as the temporal difference. The different ways in which the next action's value is calculated distinguish different reinforcement learning algorithms. In this case, we use the best possible action in the next state as reference, to try to approximate the best Q function directly. This is based on the Bellman equation. In general, this strategy results in a more efficient algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, with Q-learning, the experienced value for an action is the sum of the direct reward for that action and the best possible value for the next state-action pair. To balance the value attributed in the immediate reward with the value attributed to future action values, we use a discount factor $\\gamma$. This value ranges from 0 to 1, determining how far-sighted the agent is. The experienced action values are calculated as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "Experienced action value $= r_{t} + \\gamma \\cdot Q(s_{t+1}, a_{best})$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning rate\n",
    "\n",
    "When a model performs an action and receives feedback, it must incorporate this feedback to \"learn\" from this experience. This means that the known action values must be updated to match this experience. However, simply setting the known value for that action to the experienced value in this instance would create an unstable model, as unknown probabilities can influence the result. Instead, the value that resulted from the action taken is compared to the currently known action value, and the known value for that action is moved towards the experienced value by a learning rate (lr). Higher learning rates should mean faster convergence, but can also cause imprecision and instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "New value $=$ Previous estimate $+$ lr $\\cdot ($ Experienced value - Previous estimate $)$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exploration vs exploitation\n",
    "\n",
    "For an RL model to learn, it must experience the environment. So, training involves realizing the actions and receiving feedback from them. While the model is training, it selects its actions based on its state, and the currently known action values of the actions in that state. So, as previously mentioned, choosing the action with the highest action value should bring the best result. However, the action values are always just estimates, which means there is a chance that an unknown set of actions can lead to an unexpectedly high return. So, to learn the true best action values, it is necessary to explore alternatives instead of sticking to the currently known best action. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, when selecting an action, there is a probability that the action is selected randomly instead of based on action values. This probability is called epsilon. In theory, epsilon should be high when training begins, but should be gradually lowered as the model learns more about the environment, and the known action values are more likely to be accurate. Choosing a random action is known as exploration, while choosing the known best action is known as exploitation. Too much exploitation and the model will not learn enough about the environment, while too much exploration can cause the model to waste time and not converge in a reasonable amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The agent begins picking actions at random, assuming equal value to every action.\n",
    "2. The model estimates an action's value through both its reward and the value of the best known next action.\n",
    "3. The corresponding action's value gets updated to reflect this estimated value according to a learning rate.\n",
    "4. The agent now sometimes takes the best possible action and sometimes explores, according to the exploration factor epsilon.\n",
    "5. Over time, the difference between an action's known value and its estimated value decreases, as does epsilon, resulting in convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation of neural networks to form deep Q networks\n",
    "\n",
    "For continuous observations, we can no longer store an action value for each possible action at each possible state, since there are infinite states. Instead, we create a neural network that maps the observation (the information that describes the state) to a set of the action values of that state. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Neural networks can have varying numbers of layers and neurons.\n",
    "- More layers and neurons can help fit more complex relationships but result in lower efficiency and the possibility of over-fitting.\n",
    "\n",
